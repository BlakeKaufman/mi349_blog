        Hello, my name is Blake Kaufman and welcome to my blog. You might be
        wondering who I am so here is a short list of my interests to help you
        get to know me better.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Bitcoin: I am fascinated that we have been able to create a system of
          value outside of a centralized entity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fitness: Staying active is a huge part of my life and allows me to
          push me in a way that is conditional solely on my effort alone.
        </li>
        <li>
          Coding: I love building things that can help people. Also, each
          project has its struggles and I love the feeling of completing hard
          tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Learning: Curiosity is what drives me. Whether it's curiosity about
          how far I can push my body(fitness), curiosity of how knowledgeable I
          can become on a topic(learning), I love understand things.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stargazing: The universe is unexplainably beautiful. When you look up
          to the stars, you cannot help but think about the endless
          possibilities that are out there.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Now, if I didn't give you a picture of what I looked like and you read
        that list you might think I was 45 years old. And yes, I have old
        hobbies, but that gives me an interesting perspective on ideas. Since I
        am young, 21 years old, I have less life context, giving me the ability
        to more clearly and less biasedly look at ideas. I hope you can
        appreciate the unique perspective I share while you read some of my
        posts.
