        Hello, my name is Blake Kaufman and welcome to my blog. You might be
        wondering who I am so here is a short list of my interests to help you
        get to know me better.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Bitcoin</li>
        <li>Fitness</li>
        <li>Coding</li>
        <li>Learning</li>
        <li>Stargazing</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Now, if I didn't give you a picture of what I looked like and you read
        that list you might think I was 45 years old. And yes, I have old
        hobbies, but that gives me an interesting perspective on ideas. Since I
        am young, 21 years old, I have less life context, giving me the ability
        to more clearly and less biasedly look at ideas. I hope you can
        appreciate the unique perspective I share while you read some of my
        posts.
