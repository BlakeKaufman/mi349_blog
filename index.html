          <p>
            How do you explain something that has so many different pieces? To
            start, we can look at the title of
            <a
              title="PDF document of the Bitcoin whitepaper"
              href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"
              >the Bitcoin whitepaper</a
            >
            stating Bitcoin is a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. Let's
            break that down so we can better understand what that means.
          </p>

          <p>
            First is the Peer-to-Peer piece. Unlike current traditional payment
            rails, credit cards, debit cards, Venmo, Cash App, and Paypal which
            require a trusted third party to manage your money, Bitcoin works
            where everyone has custody over their funds. Think about a
            transaction where one person gives the other person a $5 bill. While
            this is a very simple example, this is the best analogy to how
            Bitcoin works. When one person sends money to the other, no one
            needs to approve or allow that transaction, it can just occur!
          </p>
          <p>
            The next piece is the fact that Bitcoin is completely digital. The
            breakthrough that made Bitcoin special was the solution to<a
              href="https://www.baeldung.com/cs/distributed-systems-the-byzantine-generals-problem"
            >
              the Byzantine general's problem</a
            >
            which allowed for the coordination of distributed systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now you might be wondering, why is Bitcoin important. Well, Bitcoin
            solves the problem of governments interfering with markets through
            the manipulation of currency. In traditional capitalist markets
            dollars are votes and signal to the entreprenueers what people are
            demanding. However, when governments print money, devalue the
            currency, giving more votes out, it destabilizes the capitalist
            process leading to a lot of inefficiency. So, by using a currency
            that no single entity can control the issuance of, we can solve the
            problem of currency manipulation. Also, by using a currency where
            each person has custody over their funds, we can also minimize the
            chances of theft and violence against one another because it becomes
            a lot more difficult to steal someone else's wealth.

          <h2>Why Students Don't Put Effort Into Classes</h2>

          <p>
            On the surface, school is labeled as the place to learn, explore new
            ideas, and figure out what you want to do in the world. And, while
            this sounds great, why do most people not want to go to school, or
            actively participate in it?
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe the lack of interest in school is because learning is
            hard, and effort is only given when there is an appropriate reward
            associated with it. As humans, we chase outcomes that can provide us
            the most from the least. In business this is called profits,
            creating the lowest costs while trying to maximize the highest
            return. In survival, this is retrieving the most calorie-dense food,
            for the least amount of effort. And in school, this means learning
            the material while spending the least amount of time possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, this shows, that if students are not spending the time to learn
            the material in a class, it must mean those students do not believe
            the material is something valuable enough to spend their time on.
            Now, this is not to say it is the teacher's fault. Every student has
            varying levels of effort for rewards. But it does mean, that there
            is a disconnect between the value that education believes they are
            providing and the value that students believe they are receiving.
